# MPNeuron and Logic Gates

This repository contains a Python implementation of the MPNeuron class and basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT).

## MPNeuron Class

The `MPNeuron` class represents a simplified model of a biological neuron. It takes multiple inputs, applies weights, and produces a binary output based on a threshold.

## Logic Gates

- **AND Gate**: An AND gate implemented using the `MPNeuron` class.
- **OR Gate**: An OR gate implemented using the `MPNeuron` class.
- **NOT Gate**: A NOT gate implemented using the `MPNeuron` class.

## Usage

You can test the implemented gates by running the provided test cases in the script.

```python
python logic_gates.py
